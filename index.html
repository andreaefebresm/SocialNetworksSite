            <p class="brief">At the beginning of 2019, according to the report Digital 2019, the digital users spent more than 2 hours and 16 minutes per day on Social Networks. Moreover Global Digital Yearbook, carried out by Hootsuite and We Are
              Social, points out the 44 most social countries in the World. These countries exceed the 36 minutes average amount of time per day spent on Social Networks via any device. Referring to the Human Geography (2008) of Jerome D. Fellmann,
              the
              World can be divided in 11 macro-regions that share cultural and historical experience. A further division was made for Europe, which was split in three parts: Northern, Southern and Middle European cultural area.</p>
